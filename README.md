# 🧪 Trendyol Test Automation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on automated testing of e-commerce user flows inspired by real-world scenarios.  
The main goal is to ensure **application reliability**, **risk reduction**, and **engineering quality** through test automation.

---

## Features
- Automated test scenarios for critical user flows
- Page Object Model (POM) structure
- Scalable and maintainable test architecture
- Focus on regression and smoke testing
- Realistic e-commerce test cases

---

## Tech Stack
- Java  
- Selenium  
- TestNG / JUnit  
- Maven  
- Git & GitHub  

---

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs
- Chose Page Object Model to improve test readability and maintenance.
- Focused on critical user journeys rather than exhaustive UI testing.
- Prioritized stability and clarity over excessive abstraction.
- Avoided brittle test designs that are hard to maintain over time.

---

## Product & Business Perspective
- Reduces the risk of production bugs by validating core purchase flows.
- Helps teams release features faster with higher confidence.
- Supports continuous delivery by catching regressions early.
- Improves overall product quality and customer satisfaction.

---

## Engineering Mindset
This project demonstrates a quality-driven mindset where testing is treated as a **core engineering practice**, not an afterthought.

---

## Future Improvements
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Cross-browser testing
- Test reporting and dashboards
- Parallel test execution

---
